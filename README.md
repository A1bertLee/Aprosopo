# Unnamed Theme #2 (until I come up with a better name)
A personal theme based loosely on Soda Theme by Ian Hill (http://buymeasoda.com/).

Except for the blatant reuse of the soda icons, all of the other graphics have been created from scratch, though styling takes inspiration from themes mentioned below.  Eventually I will get around to creating search icons...probably...

Unnamed Theme 2 takes inspiration from:

- Phoenix Theme: https://github.com/netatoo/phoenix-theme
- Nil Theme: https://github.com/nilium/st2-nil-theme
- Flatland Theme: https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland
- Tommorrow Night Eighties Color Scheme: https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme

# Overview
It is highly configurable in regards to to setting colors and styles of `active` and `dirty` indicators.

Example of some tab style cominations (blue dark theme with red dirty color):

# Questions
## Package Control Distribution?
I don't know.  I really did this just for personal use, but I usually open up personal plugins to others.  If well received, then maybe.

## ST3 and ST2?
As far as I know.

## Retina?
Theoretically, but I don't have a retina display to test on.

# Installation
Clone as `Theme - Faceless` in Sublime's `Packages` folder.  If I can ever think of a good name, this will change.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facelessuser/UnnamedTheme2/ "Theme - Faceless"
```

# Setup
Everything is driven via the menu.  Go to `Preferences > Package Settings > Theme - Faceless` and set the theme with the color of your choice (a restart may be required after initially setting the theme, but subsequent color and feature changes shouldn't require a restart).  Themes can be unset from the menu as well which should completely cleanup all settings etc.
